# Using-Deep-CNN-to-enhance-low-res-photos-to-match-the-quality-of-DSLR-cameras
In recent years, there has been a significant improvement in the quality of mobile cameras, bringing mobile photography to a substantially new level. However, when it comes to artistic quality, mobile devices still fall behind their DSLR counterparts. To overcome this problem, we present an end-to-end deep learning approach that bridges this gap by translating ordinary low-res photos into DSLR-quality images. We propose learning the translation function using a deep convolutional neural network that improves both color rendition and image sharpness by taking content, color and texture losses together as the loss function and trying to minimize it.
